	<h1>Read Me ~ Hauser Gallery</h1>

	<p>This gallery is named after <a href='http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/' target='_blank'>Herwig Hauser</a>, mathematician and professor of mathematics at the University of Vienna.</p>

	<p>As noted on his unversity web page, in 2008, Professor Hauser helped prepare material for <a href='http://www.imaginary-exhibition.com/' target='_blank'>"Imaginary"</a>
		- which is described as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
	An interactive travelling exhibition by the Mathematischen Forschungsinstituts Oberwolfach for the Year of Mathematics 2008 in Germany. 
	Its intention is to display visualizations, interactive installations, virtual realities, 3D objects and their theoretical background 
	in algebraic geometry and in singularity theory in an attracting and understandable manner. Itâ€™s a unique science experience!
	</blockquote>
	
	<p>The Wikipedia entry for <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_(exhibition)' target='_blank'>exhibition</a> 
	shows an image of the work 'Citric' - as shown below - which is the title image for the exhibit and credits Professor Hauser as the artist. The exhibition
	is having a very succssful run and continues to travel to new sites to this day</p>

	<p>Arising out of this work, Professor Hauser's web page contains this web page <a href='http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/bildergalerie/gallery.html' target='_blank'>Algebraic Surfaces</a>
		as well as a link to this <a href='http://homepage.univie.ac.at/herwig.hauser/animationenvonflaechen/Galleries/picturegallery.html' target='_blank'>Picture Gallery</a>.
	</p>

	<p>These images have been quite extensively copied around the web. They have inspired many people as to further investigate the beauty of algebraic surfaces.</p>

	<p>The visualizations in the following two galleries are reinterpreations of the equations in Hauser's gallery. 
	The differences are that the new visulizations are created on the fly and are fully interacive and editable.</p>

	<blockquote>Choose a polynomial in three variables with not more than three or four monomials of moderate degree. 
		Take simple coefficients as 1 and -1. Then draw a picture of the solution variety in real three space using a ray-tracing program like POV-Ray, Surf or Spicy. Go to your colleague in the next room, show her/him the picture and ask for a suitable equation. 
		This is the theme of the article: The problem of recognizing the algebraic definition of a geometric object, in this case a real algebraic surface. 
		We do not offer any answers or results. 24 surfaces are presented, each in two different views, but without equations. 
		The reader may try to find them -- or consult the calendar at this http URL [no longer available], 
		where the equations are displayed one per day together with a short animation of the surface.
